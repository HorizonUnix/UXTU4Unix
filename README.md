## Supported APU/CPU
> [!NOTE]
> - AMD Zen-based processor that supported [NootedRed](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed) **or** [UXTU](https://github.com/JamesCJ60/Universal-x86-Tuning-Utility) **Premade Preset** section (or just simply support RyzenAdj)

## Usage

- Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org).
- Download official build from [Releases](https://github.com/AppleOSX/UXTU4Mac/releases).
- Run `UXTU4Mac.command`.
- Follow the instructions.
- [Optional] Disable `Core Performance Boost` in BIOS using [Smokeless_UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF) to get better temperature but sacrifice a lot of performance.
  
## For advanced users, please visit [Custom.md](Custom.md).

# Preview
> [!NOTE]
> - Auto preset results in better power management (2:30 hours of my battery usage).
> - The Extreme preset yields the full potential performance that my Ryzen 5 4500U (Renoir) can handle but only lasts for 1:30 hours of my battery usage. To achieve maximum performance, please plug in with AC.
